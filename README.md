# Rain Protocol

Rain Protocol lets you build web3 economies at any scale.

Rain includes:

- Token generation with premint AND algorithmic emissions schedule
- Definitions for time-based membership systems (up to 8 tiers)
- Bootstrapping projects and tokens via. algorithmic sales that safely rollback
  if preset targets are not met
- Tokenomics and trading engines to define primary market mechanisms such as
  distributions, buybacks, price peg maintenance, etc.
- KYC/AML verification contracts that have compatible interfaces to be used in
  combination with membership requirements
- Onchain/offchain CMS style functionality to enable metadata and other content
  about contracts to be emitted onchain and indexed offchain
- Staking contract to allow like for like deposits and rewards paid prorata for
  users, while simultaneously being eligible for multiple consuming memberships
- An algorithmic membership combinator that can mix and match any combination
  of memberships
- Escrow contract to allow many tokens to be distributed to sale participants
  automatically upon sale success, or returned to the depositor on failure.
- Factory contracts for all the above to ensure efficient and safe deployments

Much of the magic of Rain is due to the "Rain VM" which is a simple way to
define and run algorithms onchain.

The Rain VM is not really a separate VM, it still uses the EVM of course, which
makes it fully compatible with all EVM chains.

Rain scripts are a combination of low level functions (opcodes) like addition
and subtraction and very high level functions like fetching an ERC20 balance at
a given snapshot ID (Open Zeppelin), or fetching a chainlink oracle price.

Rain scripts can be expressed in a spreadsheet like syntax and importantly are
deployed as part of configuration. Rain scripts do NOT need to be compiled,
unlike Solidity which needs to be compiled directly to EVM bytecode. Typically
rain scripts are deployed as onchain code even though the EVM cannot execute
them directly. The overhead of the VM is a mere ~6.6k to load a script and 170
gas per opcode, meaning that VM contracts are only ~5-10% more expensive than
hand-written and optimised equivalent solidity code.

We believe the power of allowing your USERS to read and write their own
contracts, without needing soliditiy developers or auditors, is well worth a
few thousand gas overhead, even on L1.

## How can Rain claim to bypass developers and auditors securely?

At a high level the Rain security model is:

- Lindy (value x time) is the most important measure of security
- There are NO admin keys outside the KYC verification process which sadly
  still requires some kind of offchain review
- Rain scripts MUST be both readable and writeable by the "average" spreadsheet
  user, so that ALL scriptable functionaly is _self auditable_ by end users
- Rain scripts MUST be read only so that state changes are mediated by the
  wrapping contract at all times, and reentrancy mistakes are impossible
- Rain deployments are mediated by factories with known bytecode that deploy
  known bytecode, allowing users to verify the bytecode of a factory and trust
  it based on its Lindy score on ANY evm compatible chain without needing to
  trust the Rain developers to manage deployments
- Open source dashboards are developed and maintained that can be hosted
  locally or on IPFS to mitigate MIM/phishing/DNS attacks, the dashboards show
  the Rain scripts for ANY contract deployed by known bytecode factories AND
  warn the user about unknown bytecode, so that any lying frontend can be
  quickly and easily cross-referenced with the dashboard
- An open source javascript simulator of the Rain VM is developed and
  maintained so that the behaviour of any algorithm can be analysed offchain,
  e.g. via monte carlo statistical models, or integrations with spreadsheeting
  tools.
- An open source subgraph is maintained to allow all functionality to be fully
  indexed and queried consistently at all times
- ALL required infrastructure and participants for Rain ecosystems are
  incentivised by the system and fully open to participate in, e.g. indexers
  are subgraphs, sales set aside fees for all front ends, trade clearance bots
  earn bounties, etc. so there are NO altruistic or unsustainable tokenomic
  requirements from the rain protocol itself.
- Rain makes it much easier to express sustainable tokenomics than ponzis and
  other unsustainable models, such as building in fee based revenue models

In summary front ends are expected to compete on brand, trust, UX and price for
users.

Users are expected to read/write rain scripts to deploy their own contracts
with factories and standard dashboards.

Rain scripts are expected to be intelligible to the "average spreadsheet user"
while remaining gas efficient and secure enough to be written by non-devs, and
read by other users.

If users can write their own scripts they don't need devs.

If users can read other people's scripts they don't need auditors.

## Consuming Rain in downstream contracts

As tags and branches are both mutable in git we strongly recommend referencing
git commits directly.

In package.json this can be done by adding a line like the following to
the dependencies:

```json
"@beehiveinnovation/rain-protocol": "git+https://github.com/beehive-innovation/rain-protocol.git#<COMMIT_HASH_HERE>",
```

Generally we recommend using an audited commit WITH REMEDIATIONS but often this
may be several months behind the latest functionality. All security sensitive
decisions are your own.

## Latest audit

Audits from omniscia can be found:

- <https://omniscia.io/beehive-rain-protocol-round-2/>
- <https://omniscia.io/beehive-rain-protocol/>

It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that downstream consumers lock their dependencies to
a specific commit rather than rely on branch/tag names.

## Installation

We strongly recommend using the nix shell <https://nix.dev/tutorials/install-nix>

Once you have installed nix you can simply run `nix-shell` from the root of
this repository and it will ensure a compatible version of npm is on your path
and run npm install automatically.

If you don't use nix shell then you will need to figure out for yourself what
versions of npm are compatible with the repo. Reading the `shell.nix` file may
give clues.

## Documentation

Documentation can be found [here](https://docs.rainprotocol.xyz/).

### Run hardhat tests

Run `hardhat test` from inside the nix shell.

### Run security check

Inside the nix-shell run `security-check` which will run slither as an
automated security scanner.

### Run echidna tests

Echidna is a powerful tool designed for fuzzing/property-based testing of Ethereum smarts contracts.
Read more about Echidna [here](https://github.com/crytic/echidna).

Use `run-echidna` from inside the nix shell. Echidna will start fuzzing the contracts as declared in `echidna` folder.

### Build and serve documentation site

Inside the nix-shell run `docs-dev`. If you want to see search functionality,
you'll need to manually build and serve with `docs-build` and then `docs-serve`
since search indexing only runs for production builds.

Navigate to <http://localhost:3000/> to view the docs site generated with
Docusaurus.

Documentation files are written in Markdown and can be found under the `docs/`
directory in this repo. The main config file can be found at
`docusaurus/docusaurus.config.js`, and sidebar config at
`docusaurus/siderbars.js`

### Gas optimisations

Hardhat is configured to leverage the solidity compiler optimizer and report on
gas usage for all test runs.

In general clarity and reuse of existing standard functionality, such as
Open Zeppelin RBAC access controls, is preferred over micro-optimisation of gas
costs.

There ARE some hot performance paths such as the VM and bulk verification logic
that have aggressive assembly level gas optimisations. These optimisations
includes things like direct function pointers for VM dispatch logic and
structural sharing for potentially large lists to avoid memory expansion. It is
much more aggressive than simply bypassing some checked math for the oft-quoted
~15% assembly benefit, with savings of ~60%+ in some cases.

### Unit tests

All functionality is unit tested. The tests are in the `test` folder.

If some functionality or potential exploit is missing a test this is a bug and
so an issue and/or PR should be raised.

## Timestamps

Rain makes extensive use of block timestamps rather than block numbers.

Historically it was the inverse and everything was based on block numbers.

If you read common advice, run security scanners, linting tools, etc. then it
will state that block timestamps cannot be fully trusted because they can be
manipulated by miners. This is true to some extent, but that extent is limited.

Some mitigating factors that limit how much timestamps will drift in practise:

- Hard limit on timestamp jumps between blocks, e.g. 900 seconds max
- Future timestamps cannot be built on by other miners so won't be included in
  the longest chain
- Past timestamps increase the difficulty faster which gives miners less money
  over time
- Timestamps must always increase every block
- Honest miners will always use the most accurate time in their opinion

However, it is entirely true that if a timestamp is to be used to directly
influence the outcome of a specific transaction, such as a casino game, then a
miner can modify a _single_ or perhaps several (if the miner is very powerful)
stamps over a short period. In this way a miner can guarantee themselves a win
in the casino game, etc. if they manage to mine the block.

The use cases in Rain are ALL intended for timestamps to be referenced over a
long period of time, such as a vesting schedule or the timeout for a sale to
complete. Over a long period, timestamps are MORE accurate than block numbers
because in practise blockchains shift their average block times subtly but
measurably over days/weeks/months.

If the uniqueness of a timestamp ever matters to the security of the Rain
protocol then Rain MUST ensure uniqueness at the contract level. Solidity
promises uniqueness but some chains have subsecond block times with second
granularity timestamps, so it's unclear how uniqueness is possible in this
situation.

Timestamps are also ambiguous in their scale across contexts. For example
the evm offers timestamps as UNIX seconds, but javascript uses milliseconds.
Naively generating a timestamp in javascript then passing it to a contract will
result in a time 1000x larger than intended. For example `1640984400` in
seconds is 2022-01-01 but `1640984400000` is millis for the same time, and is
53970-09-23 in the evm! The Rain SDK helps mitigate this by correctly scaling
times generated in JavaScript but Rain contracts also enforce a `uint32` max
limit on all times used, which will revert most issues with millis, micros,
nanos, etc.
