///
/// During `Phase.ONE` the token is frozen and no longer able to be
/// traded on any AMM or directly.
///
/// The token can be redeemed during `Phase.ONE` which burns the
/// token in exchange for pro-rata erc20 tokens held by the
/// `RedeemableERC20` contract itself.
///
/// The token balances can be used indirectly for other claims,
/// promotions and events as a proof of participation in the original
/// distribution by token holders.
///
/// The token can optionally be restricted by the `Tier` contract to
/// only allow receipients with a specified membership status.
///
/// @dev `RedeemableERC20` is an ERC20 with 2 phases.
///
/// `Phase.ZERO` is the distribution phase where the token can be freely
/// transfered but not redeemed.
/// `Phase.ONE` is the redemption phase where the token can be redeemed but no
/// longer transferred.
///
/// Redeeming some amount of `RedeemableERC20` burns the token in exchange for
/// some other tokens held by the contract.
/// For example, if the `RedeemableERC20` token contract holds 100 000 USDC
/// then a holder of the redeemable token
/// can burn some of their tokens to receive a % of that USDC. If they redeemed
/// (burned) an amount equal to 10% of the redeemable token supply then
/// they would receive 10 000 USDC.
///
/// Up to 8 redeemable tokens can be registered on the redeemable contract.
/// These will be looped over by default in
/// the `redeem` function. If there is an error during redemption or more than
/// 8 tokens are to be redeemed, there is a `redeemSpecific` function that
/// allows the caller to specify exactly which of the redeemable tokens they
/// want to receive.
/// Note: the same amount of `RedeemableERC20` is burned, regardless of which
/// redeemable tokens were specified. Specifying fewer redeemable tokens will
/// NOT increase the proportion of each that is returned. `redeemSpecific` is
/// intended as a last resort if the caller cannot resolve issues causing
/// errors for one or more redeemable tokens during redemption.
///
/// `RedeemableERC20` has several owner administrative functions:
/// - Owner can add senders and receivers that can send/receive tokens even
///   during `Phase.ONE`
/// - Owner can add redeemable tokens
///   - But NOT remove them
///   - And everyone can call `redeemSpecific` to override the redeemable list
/// - Owner can end `Phase.ONE` during `Phase.ZERO` by specifying the address
///   of a distributor, which will have any undistributed tokens burned.
///
/// The intent is that the redeemable token contract is owned by a `Trust`
/// contract, NOT an externally owned account.
/// The `Trust` contract will add the minimum possible senders/receivers to
/// facilitate the AMM trading and redemption.
/// The `Trust` will also control access to managing redeemable tokens and
/// specifying the trading AMM pool as the distributor to burn to end
/// `Phase.ONE`.
///
/// The redeem functions MUST be used to redeem and burn RedeemableERC20s
/// (NOT regular transfers).
///
/// The `redeem` and `redeemSpecific` functions will simply revert if called
/// outside `Phase.ONE`.
/// A `Redeem` event is emitted on every redemption (per redeemed token) as
