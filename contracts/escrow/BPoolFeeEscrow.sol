/// gas for escrow internal accounting on top of the basic balancer swap. This
/// is Rain's "pay it forward" revenue model, rather than trying to capture and
/// pull funds back to the protocol somehow. The goal is to incentivise many
/// ecosystems that are nourished by Rain but are not themselves Rain.
///
/// Technically this might look like a website/front-end prefilling an address
/// the maintainers own and some nominal fee like 1% of each trade. The fee is
/// in absolute numbers on this contract but a GUI is free to calculate this
/// value in any way it deems appropriate. The assumption is that end-users of
/// a GUI will not manually alter the fee, because if they would do that it
/// makes more sense that they would simply call the balancer swap function
/// directly and avoid even paying the gas required by the escrow contract.
///
/// Balancer pool fees natively set aside prorata for LPs ONLY. Our `Trust`
/// requires that 100% of the LP tokens and token supply are held by the
/// managing pool contract that the `Trust` deploys. Naively we could set a
/// fee on the balancer pool and have the contract that owns the LP tokens
/// attempt to divvy the volume fees out to FEs from some registry. The issue
/// is that the Balancer contracts are all outside our control so we have no
/// way to prevent a malicious end-user or FE lying about how they interact
/// with the Balancer pool. The only way to ensure that every trade accurately
/// sets aside fees is to put a contract in between the buyer and the pool
/// that can execute the trade sans fees on the buyers's behalf.
///
/// Some important things to note about fee handling:
/// - Fees are NOT forwarded if the raise fails according to the Trust. Instead
///   they are forwarded to the redeemable token so buyers can redeem a refund.
/// - Fees are ONLY collected when tokens are purchased, thus contributing to
///   the success of a raise. When tokens are sold there are no additional fees
///   set aside by this escrow. Repeatedly buying/selling does NOT allow for
///   wash trading to claim additional fees as the user must pay the fee in
///   full in addition to the token spot price for every round-trip.
/// - ANYONE can process a claim for a recipient and/or a refund for a trust.
/// - The information about which trusts to claim/refund is available offchain
///   via the `Fee` event.
///
/// We cannot prevent FEs implementing their own smart contracts to take fees
/// outside the scope of the escrow, but we aren't encouraging or implementing
/// it for them either.
