/// @title SeedERC20
/// @notice Facilitates raising seed reserve from an open set of seeders.
///
/// When a single seeder address cannot be specified at the time the
/// `Trust` is constructed a `SeedERC20` will be deployed.
///
/// The `SeedERC20` has two phases:
///
/// - `Phase.ZERO`: Can swap seed tokens for reserve assets with `seed` and
///   `unseed`
/// - `Phase.ONE`: Can redeem seed tokens pro-rata for reserve assets
///
/// When the last seed token is distributed the `SeedERC20` immediately moves
/// to `Phase.ONE` atomically within that transaction and forwards all reserve
/// to the configured recipient.
///
/// For our use-case the recipient is a `Trust` contract but `SeedERC20`
/// could be used as a mini-fundraise contract for many purposes. In the case
/// that a recipient is not a `Trust` the recipient will need to be careful not
/// to fall afoul of KYC and securities law.
///
/// @dev Facilitates a pool of reserve funds to forward to a named recipient
/// contract.
/// The funds to raise and the recipient is fixed at construction.
/// The total is calculated as `( seedPrice * seedUnits )` and so is a fixed
/// amount. It is recommended to keep `seedUnits` relatively small so that each
/// unit represents a meaningful contribution to keep dust out of the system.
///
/// The contract lifecycle is split into two phases:
///
/// - `Phase.ZERO`: the `seed` and `unseed` functions are callable by anyone.
/// - `Phase.ONE`: holders of the seed erc20 token can redeem any reserve funds
///   in the contract pro-rata.
///
/// When `seed` is called the `SeedERC20` contract takes ownership of reserve
/// funds in exchange for seed tokens.
/// When `unseed` is called the `SeedERC20` contract takes ownership of seed
/// tokens in exchange for reserve funds.
///
/// When the last `seed` token is transferred to an external address the
/// `SeedERC20` contract immediately:
///
/// - Moves to `Phase.ONE`, disabling both `seed` and `unseed`
/// - Transfers the full balance of reserve from itself to the recipient
///   address.
///
/// Seed tokens are standard ERC20 so can be freely transferred etc.
///
/// The recipient (or anyone else) MAY transfer reserve back to the `SeedERC20`
/// at a later date.
/// Seed token holders can call `redeem` in `Phase.ONE` to burn their tokens in
/// exchange for pro-rata reserve assets.
