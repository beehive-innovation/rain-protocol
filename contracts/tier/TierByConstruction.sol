/// @title TierByConstruction
/// @notice `TierByConstruction` is a base contract for other
/// contracts to inherit from.
///
/// It exposes `isTier` and the corresponding modifier `onlyTier`.
///
/// This ensures that the address has held at least the given tier
/// since the contract was constructed.
///
/// We check against the construction time of the contract rather
/// than the current block to avoid various exploits.
///
/// Users should not be able to gain a tier for a single block, claim
/// benefits then remove the tier within the same block.
///
/// The construction block provides a simple and generic reference
/// point that is difficult to manipulate/predict.
///
/// Note that `ReadOnlyTier` contracts must carefully consider use
/// with `TierByConstruction` as they tend to return `0x00000000` for
/// any/all tiers held. There needs to be additional safeguards to
/// mitigate "flash tier" attacks.
///
/// Note that an account COULD be `TierByConstruction` then lower/
/// remove a tier, then no longer be eligible when they regain the
/// tier. Only _continuously held_ tiers are valid against the
/// construction block check as this is native behaviour of the
/// `report` function in `ITier`.
///
/// Technically the `ITier` could re-enter the `TierByConstruction`
/// so the `onlyTier` modifier runs AFTER the modified function.
///
/// @dev Enforces tiers held by contract contruction block.
/// The construction block is compared against the blocks returned by `report`.
/// The `ITier` contract is paramaterised and set during construction.
