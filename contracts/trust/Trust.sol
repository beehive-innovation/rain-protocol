/// The goals of a distribution:
/// - Mint and distribute a `RedeemableERC20` as fairly as possible,
///   prioritising true fans of a creator.
/// - Raise a minimum reserve so that a creator can deliver value to fans.
/// - Provide a safe space through membership style filters to enhance
///   exclusivity for fans.
/// - Ensure that anyone who seeds the raise (not fans) by risking and
///   providing capital is compensated.
///
/// Stakeholders:
/// - Creator: Have a project of interest to their fans
/// - Fans: Will purchase project-specific tokens to receive future rewards
///   from the creator
/// - Seeder(s): Provide initial reserve assets to seed a Balancer trading pool
/// - Deployer: Configures and deploys the `Trust` contract
///
/// The creator is nominated to receive reserve assets on a successful
/// distribution. The creator must complete the project and fans receive
/// rewards. There is no on-chain mechanism to hold the creator accountable to
/// the project completion. Requires a high degree of trust between creator and
/// their fans.
///
/// Fans are willing to trust and provide funds to a creator to complete a
/// project. Fans likely expect some kind of reward or "perks" from the
/// creator, such as NFTs, exclusive events, etc.
/// The distributed tokens are untransferable after trading ends and merely act
/// as records for who should receive rewards.
///
/// Seeders add the initial reserve asset to the Balancer pool to start the
/// automated market maker (AMM).
/// Ideally this would not be needed at all.
/// Future versions of `Trust` may include a bespoke distribution mechanism
/// rather than Balancer contracts. Currently it is required by Balancer so the
/// seeder provides some reserve and receives a fee on successful distribution.
/// If the distribution fails the seeder is returned their initial reserve
/// assets. The seeder is expected to promote and mentor the creator in
/// non-financial ways.
///
/// The deployer has no specific priviledge or admin access once the `Trust` is
/// deployed. They provide the configuration, including nominating
/// creator/seeder, and pay gas but that is all.
/// The deployer defines the conditions under which the distribution is
/// successful. The seeder/creator could also act as the deployer.
