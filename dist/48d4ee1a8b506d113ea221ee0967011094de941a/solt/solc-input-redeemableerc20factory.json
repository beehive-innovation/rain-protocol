For example, if the\n/// `RedeemableERC20` token contract holds 100 000 USDC then a holder of the\n/// redeemable token can burn some of their tokens to receive a % of that USDC.\n/// If they redeemed (burned) an amount equal to 10% of the redeemable token\n/// supply then they would receive 10 000 USDC.\n///\n/// Up to 8 redeemable tokens can be registered on the redeemable contract.\n/// These will be looped over by default in the `redeem` function. If there is\n/// an error during redemption or more than 8 tokens are to be redeemed, there\n/// is a `redeemSpecific` function that allows the caller to specify exactly\n/// which of the redeemable tokens they want to receive.\n/// Note: The same amount of `RedeemableERC20` is burned, regardless of which\n/// redeemable tokens were specified. Specifying fewer redeemable tokens will\n/// NOT increase the proportion of each that is returned. `redeemSpecific` is\n/// intended as a last resort if the caller cannot resolve issues causing\n/// errors for one or more redeemable tokens during redemption.\n///\n/// `RedeemableERC20` has several owner administrative functions:\n/// - Owner can add senders and receivers that can send/receive tokens even\n///   during `Phase.ONE`\n/// - Owner can add to the list of redeemable tokens\n///   - But NOT remove them\n///   - And everyone can call `redeemSpecific` to override the redeemable list\n/// - Owner can end `Phase.ONE` during `Phase.ZERO` by specifying the address\n///   of a distributor, which will have any undistributed tokens burned.\n///\n/// The intent is that the redeemable token contract is owned by a `Trust`\n/// contract, NOT an externally owned account. The `Trust` contract will add\n/// the minimum possible senders/receivers to facilitate the AMM trading and\n/// redemption.\n///\n/// The `Trust` will also control access to managing redeemable tokens and\n/// specifying the trading AMM pool as the distributor to burn to end\n/// `Phase.ONE`.\n///\n/// The redeem functions MUST be used to redeem and burn RedeemableERC20s\n/// (NOT regular transfers).\n///\n/// The `redeem` and `redeemSpecific` functions will simply revert if called\n/// outside `Phase.ONE`.\n/// A `Redeem` event is emitted on every redemption (per redeemed token) as\n/// `(redeemer, redeemable, redeemAmount)`.\ncontract RedeemableERC20 is\n    AccessControl,\n    Phased,\n    TierByConstruction,\n    ERC20,\n    ReentrancyGuard,\n    ERC20Burnable\n    {\n\n    using SafeMath for uint256;\n    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;\n\n    bytes32 public constant SENDER = keccak256(\"SENDER\");\n    bytes32 public constant RECEIVER = keccak256(\"RECEIVER\");\n    bytes32 public constant DISTRIBUTOR_BURNER =\n        keccak256(\"DISTRIBUTOR_BURNER\");\n    bytes32 public constant REDEEMABLE_ADDER = keccak256(\"REDEEMABLE_ADDER\");\n\n    /// Redeemable token burn for reserve.\n    event Redeem(\n        // Account burning and receiving.\n        address indexed redeemer,\n        // The token being sent to the burner.\n        address indexed redeemable,\n        // The amount of the redeemable and token being redeemed as\n        // `[redeemAmount, tokenAmount]`\n        uint256[2] redeemAmounts\n    );\n\n    /// RedeemableERC20 uses the standard/default 18 ERC20 decimals.\n    /// The minimum supply enforced by the constructor is \"one\" token which is\n    /// `10 ** 18`.\n    /// The minimum supply does not prevent subsequent redemption/burning.\n    uint256 public constant MINIMUM_INITIAL_SUPPLY = 10 ** 18;\n\n    /// The maximum number of redeemables that can be set.\n    /// Attempting to add more redeemables than this will fail with an error.\n    /// This prevents a very large loop in the default redemption behaviour.\n    uint8 public constant MAX_REDEEMABLES = 8;\n\n    /// @dev List of redeemables to loop over in default redemption behaviour.\n    /// see `getRedeemables`.\n    IERC20[] private redeemables;\n\n    /// The minimum status that a user must hold to receive transfers during\n    /// `Phase.ZERO`.\n    /// The tier contract passed to `TierByConstruction` determines if\n    /// the status is held during `_beforeTokenTransfer`.\n    /// Not immutable because it is read during the constructor by the `_mint`\n    /// call.\n    ITier.Tier public minimumTier;\n\n    /// Mint the full ERC20 token supply and configure basic transfer\n    /// restrictions.\n    /// @param config_ Constructor configuration.\n    constructor (\n        RedeemableERC20Config memory config_\n    )\n        public\n        ERC20(config_.name, config_.symbol)\n        TierByConstruction(config_.tier)\n    {\n        require(\n            config_.totalSupply >= MINIMUM_INITIAL_SUPPLY,\n            \"MINIMUM_INITIAL_SUPPLY\"\n        );\n        minimumTier = config_.minimumStatus;\n\n        _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, config_.admin);\n        _setupRole(RECEIVER, config_.admin);\n\n        _mint(config_.admin, config_.totalSupply);\n    }\n\n    /// The admin can burn all tokens of a single address to end `Phase.ZERO`.\n    /// The intent is that during `Phase.ZERO` there is some contract\n    /// responsible for distributing the tokens.\n    /// The admin specifies the distributor to end `Phase.ZERO` and all\n    /// undistributed tokens are burned.\n    /// The distributor is NOT set during the constructor because it likely\n    /// doesn't exist at that point.
