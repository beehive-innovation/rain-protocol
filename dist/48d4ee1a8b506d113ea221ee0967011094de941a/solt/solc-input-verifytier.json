A government\n/// regulator is going to want a government issued ID cross-referenced against\n/// international sanctions. A fan of some social media influencer wants to\n/// see a verified account on that platform. An open source software project\n/// should show a github profile. A security token may need evidence from an\n/// accountant showing accredited investor status. There are so many ways in\n/// which BOTH sides of a fundraise may need to verify something about\n/// themselves to each other via a THIRD PARTY that Rain cannot assume much.\n///\n/// The trust model and process for Rain verification is:\n///\n/// - There are many `Verify` contracts, each represents a specific\n///   verification method with a (hopefully large) set of possible reviewers.\n/// - The verifyee compiles some evidence that can be referenced by ID in some\n///   relevant system. It could be a session ID in a KYC provider's database or\n///   a tweet from a verified account, etc. The ID is a `uint256` so should be\n///   enough to fit just about any system ID, it is large enough to fit a hash,\n///   2x UUIDs or literally any sequential ID.\n/// - The verifyee calls `add` _for themselves_ to include their ID under their\n///   account, after which they _cannot change_ their submission without\n///   appealing to someone who can remove. This costs gas, so why don't we\n///   simply ask the user to sign something and have an approver verify the\n///   signed data? Because we want to leverage both the censorship resistance\n///   and asynchronous nature of the underlying blockchain. Assuming there are\n///   N possible approvers, we want ANY 1 of those N approvers to be able to\n///   review and approve an application. If the user is forced to submit their\n///   application directly to one SPECIFIC approver we lose this property. In\n///   the gasless model the user must then rely on their specific approver both\n///   being online and not to censor the request. It's also possible that many\n///   accounts add the same ID, after all the ID will be public onchain, so it\n///   is important for approvers to verify the PAIRING between account and ID.\n/// - ANY account with the `APPROVER` role can review the added ID against the\n///   records in the system referenced by the ID. IF the ID is valid then the\n///   `approve` function should be called by the approver.\n/// - ANY account with the `BANNER` role can veto either an add OR a prior\n///   approval. In the case of a false positive, i.e. where an account was\n///   mistakenly approved, an appeal can be made to a banner to update the\n///   status. Bad accounts SHOULD BE BANNED NOT REMOVED. When an account is\n///   removed, its onchain state is once again open for the attacker to\n///   resubmit a new fraudulent session ID and potentially be reapproved.\n///   Once an account is banned, any attempt by the account holder to change\n///   their session ID, or an approver to approve will be rejected. Downstream\n///   consumers of a `State` MUST check for an existing ban.\n///   - ANY account with the `REMOVER` role can scrub the `State` from an\n///   account. Of course, this is a blockchain so the state changes are all\n///   still visible to full nodes and indexers in historical data, in both the\n///   onchain history and the event logs for each state change. This allows an\n///   account to appeal to a remover in the case of a MISTAKEN BAN or also in\n///   the case of a MISTAKEN ADD (e.g. wrong ID value), effecting a\n///   \"hard reset\" at the contract storage level.\n///\n/// Banning some account with an invalid session is NOT required. It is\n/// harmless for an added session to remain as `Status.Added` indefinitely.\n/// For as long as no approver decides to approve some invalid added session it\n/// MUST be treated as equivalent to a ban by downstream contracts.\n///\n/// Rain uses standard Open Zeppelin `AccessControl` and is agnostic to how the\n/// approver/remover/banner roles and associated admin roles are managed.\n/// Ideally the more credibly neutral qualified parties assigend to each role\n/// for each `Verify` contract the better.
